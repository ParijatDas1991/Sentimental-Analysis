The purpose of these team norms is to get our expectations on the same page. 

## As members of the team, we agree to not:

* Work on issues with an unclear definition of done
* Use phones/laptops excessively in meetings

## As members of the team, we agree to:

* Qt Team Values: Pragmatic, experimental, curious, solution-oriented, forward-looking, considerate, open, helpful ....
* Clear up misunderstandings & conflicts (technical and personal) as they arise - talk with the person, or Lucas / James / Parijat
* No question is a silly question! Anyone and everyone can ask anything and everything.
* If you don't understand something, ask for help earlier than later, as the group is kind!
* Slack communications: have communications in general channels versus one-to-one DMs (qt-channels, threads).
* Be mindful of scope creep! If you face scope creep create an issue and make sure it is in the triage pipeline.  
* Okay to be the messenger of bad news. If you see a problem that other haven’t noticed, bring it to someone’s attention
* Speak up if a discussion is getting off track
* Meetings: In general, first meeting, 8:30am PST, 10:30am CST, 11:30am EST. The general idea is not to make Edinburgh people stay longer, could be latest up to 6 PM Edinburgh time(10:00am PST, 12:00pm CST, 1:00pm EST).
* When issue ready for verification, provide clear instructions to complete the testing; build#, platforms, steps, [definition of done](https://devtopia.esri.com/runtime/qt-common/wiki/Definition-of-Done)
* If only one platform needs to be tested/verified please make sure to mention that in the issue. 
* When closing an issue, list build# used, platforms tested, and any additional testing performed
* Code reviews mandatory for all changes, no matter how trivial.
* In general, PRs should have 1 reviewer, optionally more. If there are API changes, an API reviewer and if there are doc changes, the developer is responsible for reviewing the changes(no need to add a doc reviewer). If in doubt assign it to James(also could drop a slack message to bring his attention). 
* PR response (by reviewer) should be within 24 hours. It's okay to respond with "I do not have enough time to review it".
* All non-trivial API changes require API vTest when creating PRs.
* Try to keep cameras on during meetings(helps to build better communication) .
* Follow Kanban working pattern where we limit the WIP(Work In Progress) pipeline. Try to pull new task in WIP once the previous is completed unless they are blocked/dependent on other tasks. 
* Daily Scrums: Pull one item in progress unless it's blocked. Don't open blocked issues. Take longer discussion to parking lot(extended scrum where concerned parties stay back). Start promptly on time.
* Qt RSS Forum questions: Comment in a thread if you are taking on the issue. Try to get a response to the user within a day. Try to be helpful while keeping in mind we have a technical support team. For example, do: test out simple things, point them to doc, etc; don’t: attempt to set up complicated/ambiguous repros, write custom solutions, spend more than a few hours. Refer users to support services for these more involved scenarios.
