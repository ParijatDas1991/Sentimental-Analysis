Sometime you may want to write a blog post to highlight product features, describe useful workflows, or inform our users about important information. This topic will give you some pointers to get started. 

# Blog formats

We have 2 different blogs - the ["ArcGIS" blog](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/overview/) and [GeoNet blog](https://community.esri.com/community/developers/native-app-developers/arcgis-runtime-sdk-for-qt/content?filterID=contentstatus%5Bpublished%5D~objecttype~objecttype%5Bblogpost%5D). The ArcGIS Blog is good for reaching a broader audience and describing things like capabilities, new features, or critical announcements. The GeoNet blog is better for nitty gritty details, Qt specific tips and tricks, and lower level or seemingly random bits of info that Qt developers might like to see, but other ArcGIS users would likely be confused by. If you post on the ArcGIS blog, you could also create a GeoNet blog that links to the primary blog.
